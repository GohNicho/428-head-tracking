test_bluetooth.pde

this is a sketch that runs in the processing language that runs on the computer
to test a bluetooth connection on arduino.  

two boxes are drawn and if you click on them, one turns the arduino onboard light on
and the other turns it off.

for this to work a compatible sketch has to be installed on the arduino

HC05_with_Computer_TEST

is the sketch that runs on the arduino, but didn’t work with the bluetooth shield that we are using.

blue_tooth_slave.ino

this file works with our bluetooth shield, so this is the one that we use to test the lights, and the bluetooth connection.
